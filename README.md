# neural-disaggregator

Implementations of NILM disaggegregators using Neural Networks, implemented using [NILMTK](https://github.com/NILMTK/NILMTK) and Keras.

Most of the architectures are based on [Neural NILM: Deep Neural Networks Applied to Energy Disaggregation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.06594.pdf) by Jack Kelly and William Knottenbelt

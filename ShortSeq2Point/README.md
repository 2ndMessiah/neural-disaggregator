# Short Sequence to Point Energy Disaggregator

As described in:

[Sliding Window Approach for Online Energy Disaggregation Using Artificial Neural Networks](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3201011) by Krystalakos, Nalmpantis and Vrakas.

Based on [Sequence-to-point learning with neural networks for nonintrusive load monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09106) by Zhang et al. Sequence-to-point learning with neural networks for nonintrusive load monitoring.

See example experiment [here](https://github.com/OdysseasKr/neural-disaggregator/blob/master/ShortSeq2Point/ShortSeq2Point-example.ipynb).
